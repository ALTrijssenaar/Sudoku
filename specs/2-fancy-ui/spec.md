# Feature Specification: Fancy, Efficient .NET Web UI for Sudoku Platform (Feature 2)


## Feature Number
2-fancy-ui

## Overview

This feature delivers a modern, visually appealing, and highly efficient web-based user interface for the Sudoku platform. The UI will be powered by the latest .NET technologies and hosted on the web, providing seamless access for users to play, resume, and track Sudoku puzzles.

## Actors
- End Users (Sudoku players)
- Platform Administrators (optional, for configuration)

## User Scenarios & Testing
1. A user registers or logs in and is presented with a visually engaging dashboard.
2. The user selects a puzzle difficulty and starts a new game.
3. The user interacts with the puzzle board using intuitive controls (cell selection, value entry, undo/redo, hints).
4. The user can save progress, exit, and later resume the puzzle from the last saved state.
5. The user can view their history of completed puzzles and progress.
6. The UI provides instant feedback on cell validity and puzzle completion.
7. All actions are fast, responsive, and require minimal clicks/taps.

## Functional Requirements
- The UI must be web-hosted and accessible via modern browsers.
- The UI must use the latest .NET technology (e.g., ASP.NET Core, Blazor, or successor).
- The interface must be visually appealing, with modern design elements and smooth animations.
- Users must be able to register, login, start puzzles, save progress, resume sessions, and view history.
- The UI must support difficulty selection and display puzzle boards clearly.
- All interactions (cell entry, navigation, feedback) must be highly efficient and intuitive.
- The UI must integrate with the existing backend API for all data operations.
- The UI must provide instant feedback on cell validity and puzzle completion.
- The UI must be responsive and usable on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Accessibility standards must be met (contrast, keyboard navigation, screen reader support).

## Success Criteria
- 95% of user actions complete in under 300ms (measured from click/tap to visible response).
- Users can start, save, and resume puzzles with no more than 2 clicks/taps per action.
- 90% of users rate the UI as "easy to use" and "visually appealing" in user surveys.
- All major browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari) are supported.
- Accessibility tests pass for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance.
- No critical bugs or blockers in user flows during acceptance testing.

## Key Entities
- User
- Puzzle
- GameSession
- Difficulty

## Assumptions
- The backend API is stable and provides all required endpoints.
- .NET web UI technology (e.g., Blazor) is available and supported for this project.
- Industry-standard UI/UX patterns are acceptable for Sudoku gameplay.
- Platform administrators may configure UI themes and settings (optional).

## Dependencies
- Backend API for authentication, puzzle data, session management, and history.
- Existing data models for User, Puzzle, GameSession, Difficulty.

## Edge Cases
- User loses connection while playing or saving progress.
- User attempts invalid moves (e.g., duplicate values in a row/column/box).
- Accessibility needs for users with disabilities.
- Mobile device compatibility and touch interactions.

## Out of Scope
- Native mobile apps (iOS/Android)
- Non-.NET web frameworks
- Backend API changes (unless required for UI integration)
