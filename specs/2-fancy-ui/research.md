# Research: Fancy, Efficient .NET Web UI (Feature 2)

## Decision: .NET Web UI Technology
- Chosen: Blazor WebAssembly (latest stable)
- Rationale: Blazor offers modern, interactive, client-side UI with .NET, supports responsive design, and integrates well with REST APIs.
- Alternatives: ASP.NET Core MVC (less interactive), Uno Platform (cross-platform, less mature), MAUI Blazor Hybrid (not web-hosted)

## Decision: Accessibility & Responsiveness
- Chosen: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, mobile-first responsive design
- Rationale: Ensures usability for all users, meets legal and business standards
- Alternatives: WCAG 2.0 (older), custom accessibility (risk of missing standards)

## Decision: Integration Pattern
- Chosen: RESTful API integration using HttpClient
- Rationale: Existing backend exposes REST endpoints, HttpClient is standard in Blazor
- Alternatives: GraphQL (not supported by backend), direct DB access (not secure)

## Decision: UI/UX Best Practices
- Chosen: Material Design-inspired components, smooth animations, instant feedback
- Rationale: Familiar, modern, efficient for users
- Alternatives: Custom design (higher cost), Bootstrap (less modern look)

## All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
