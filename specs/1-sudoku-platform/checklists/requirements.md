# Specification Quality Checklist: Sudoku - Individual Player Platform

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Feature**: specs/1-sudoku-platform/spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Notes

- Content Quality: PASS — The spec focuses on user journeys and avoids implementation details. Example: "The system MUST allow users to register and sign in to a personal account." (FR-001) is implementation-agnostic.
- Requirement Completeness: PASS — Requirements are phrased as testable statements (FR-001..FR-007). All acceptance scenarios are present for the main user stories.
- Feature Readiness: CAUTION — SC-004 references "backtracking more than X times" which leaves a placeholder X; this should be defined in iteration planning. This is an item for planning but not a blocker for the spec.

## Notes

- The PowerShell script `.specify/scripts/powershell/create-new-feature.ps1` could not be executed in this environment due to runtime limitations. As a result, the branch was not created or checked out here. Suggested next step: run the following locally in PowerShell in the repository root to create the branch and wire the spec into the repo:

```powershell
.specify\scripts\powershell\create-new-feature.ps1 -Json '{"description": "Develop Sudoku, a individual user platform to solve Sudoku games. Allow users to login, select a level of the Sudoku and solve the Sudoku."}' -Json -Number 1 -ShortName "sudoku-platform"
```

- After running the script locally, verify that the branch `1-sudoku-platform` exists and that `specs/1-sudoku-platform/spec.md` is tracked and correct.
