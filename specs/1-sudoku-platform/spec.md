# Feature Specification: Sudoku - Individual Player Platform

**Feature Branch**: `1-sudoku-platform`  
**Created**: 2025-10-31  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Develop Sudoku, a individual user platform to solve Sudoku games. Allow users to login, select a level of the Sudoku and solve the Sudoku."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Start and Solve a Puzzle (Priority: P1)

A registered user wants to quickly start a Sudoku at a chosen difficulty and solve it using an intuitive board view.

**Why this priority**: Core user value — enables the primary purpose of the product: solving Sudoku puzzles as an individual experience.

**Independent Test**: Create a new user account or use an existing account, sign in, select a difficulty, begin a puzzle, and complete it.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a registered user who is signed in, **When** they choose "Start Puzzle" at difficulty "Easy", **Then** a valid, solvable Sudoku board at Easy difficulty is presented and the user can interact with the board cells.
2. **Given** a signed-in user mid-puzzle, **When** they enter a number into a cell, **Then** the value is accepted if it does not conflict with existing rules and the board state updates visually.
3. **Given** a user completes the final correct value, **When** the system validates the board, **Then** the puzzle is marked as completed and a completion confirmation is shown.

### User Story 2 - Choose Difficulty and Resume (Priority: P2)

Users want to pick a difficulty level and be able to resume an in-progress puzzle later.

**Why this priority**: Enables personalized challenge levels and retention — users who can continue puzzles later are more likely to engage repeatedly.

**Independent Test**: Sign in, start a puzzle on "Medium", save or leave, sign out and sign back in, and resume the same puzzle.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a signed-in user, **When** they open the difficulty selector and choose "Medium", **Then** a Medium-difficulty puzzle starts.
2. **Given** a user who has an in-progress puzzle, **When** they return within a reasonable period, **Then** they can resume from the last saved state.

### User Story 3 - Account Management and Progress (Priority: P3)

Users want to use an account so their progress, history of solved puzzles, and basic preferences are retained.

**Why this priority**: Supports personalization and basic user lifecycle; not strictly required to start solving puzzles if anonymous play is allowed, but important for retention.

**Independent Test**: Register or sign in, solve multiple puzzles across difficulties, and verify that completed puzzles appear in the user history.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new user, **When** they register and sign in, **Then** they can start puzzles and completed puzzles are recorded in their profile history.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a puzzle generation fails (e.g., no valid puzzle of requested difficulty)? The system should show a clear error message and offer to try again or select a different difficulty.
- How does the system handle intermittent connectivity while solving (user edits offline then reconnects)? The spec assumes online-first operation; partial local caching or offline-first behavior is out of scope for the initial MVP.
- User enters invalid input (non-numeric or numbers outside 1-9) — inputs should be constrained client-side and validated server-side.
- Concurrent sessions: If the same account is used in multiple browser tabs/devices, the most recent valid save should be the authoritative state; collisions must be resolved in favor of data integrity (show a warning if an overwrite occurs).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST allow users to register and sign in to a personal account.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST allow signed-in users to select a difficulty level (e.g., Easy, Medium, Hard) and start a new Sudoku puzzle at that difficulty.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST present an interactive Sudoku board that the user can edit cell values and receive immediate validation feedback for obvious rule violations.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST persist in-progress puzzle state for signed-in users so they can resume later.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST detect puzzle completion and mark puzzles as completed in the user's history.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST provide clear, human-readable error messages when an operation fails (puzzle generation, save, validation).
- **FR-007**: The system MUST support puzzle generation that ensures puzzles are solvable and match the requested difficulty distribution.

*Assumptions*: Unless the product owner specifies otherwise, the following assumptions are used for testability and scope:

- Accounts are unique per email address; password resets and advanced account settings are out of scope for initial delivery.
- Difficulty levels are predefined as Easy / Medium / Hard.
- The initial MVP targets online use; offline play and synchronization are out of scope.
- Leaderboards, social features, and timed contests are out of scope for the initial feature.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **User**: Represents a registered person using the platform. Attributes: user id, display name, email, registration date, completed puzzle history (list of puzzle ids and metadata).
- **SudokuPuzzle**: A representation of a generated puzzle. Attributes: puzzle id, difficulty, initial cells, solution, generation timestamp.
- **GameSession**: A user-specific in-progress or completed play instance. Attributes: session id, user id, puzzle id, current board state, started_at, last_saved_at, completed_at, status (in-progress/completed).

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: At least 95% of users can start a new puzzle after signing in within 10 seconds on a standard broadband connection.
- **SC-002**: 90% of generated puzzles labeled Easy/Medium/Hard are solvable and validated by automated puzzle checks before being presented to users.
- **SC-003**: 90% of users who begin a puzzle and return within 7 days can successfully resume the same puzzle with their last saved state intact.
- **SC-004**: 85% first-attempt success rate for users completing Easy puzzles (as measured by completion without backtracking more than X times) — X to be defined in iteration planning.
- **SC-005**: User-facing error messages are provided for common failure modes and users can understand next steps (qualitative validation via initial usability testing).


## Assumptions

- The platform will be delivered as an online-first MVP.
- Authentication, account lifecycle, and basic persistence are available in the environment.
- Puzzle difficulty mapping and generation quality are covered by a puzzle generator component (detailed implementation out of scope).
