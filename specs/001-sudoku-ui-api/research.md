# Research Summary: Sudoku UI & API

**Feature Branch**: `001-sudoku-ui-api`
**Date**: 2025-11-01

## Decisions & Rationale

### UI Framework
- **Decision**: Blazor
- **Rationale**: Blazor integrates seamlessly with .NET, supports SPA features, and is maintainable for .NET teams.
- **Alternatives Considered**: React (popular, but requires more integration work with .NET), Angular (less common for .NET).

### Storage
- **Decision**: PostgreSQL
- **Rationale**: PostgreSQL is robust, scalable, and well-supported for containerized, multi-user environments. It is ideal for production and cloud deployments.
- **Alternatives Considered**: SQLite (simple, best for local/dev, not ideal for concurrent/multi-user scenarios).

### UI Testing Tool
- **Decision**: Playwright
- **Rationale**: Playwright is modern, fast, and supports cross-browser testing. It integrates well with CI/CD and is recommended for new .NET web projects.
- **Alternatives Considered**: Selenium (older, slower, less modern features).

## Summary
All major technical choices align with the constitution and project goals. The selected stack is modern, scalable, and maintainable for a containerized .NET solution.
