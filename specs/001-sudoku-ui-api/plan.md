# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary


Create a web-based UI and a RESTful API for playing Sudoku. The UI interacts with the API for puzzle generation, move validation, and state persistence. The API manages game sessions, validates moves, and provides feedback. All business logic is handled server-side; the UI is kept simple.

## Technical Context


**Language/Version**: .NET 8 (latest stable)
**Primary Dependencies**: ASP.NET Core (API), Blazor (UI)
**Storage**: PostgreSQL
**Testing**: xUnit for backend, Playwright for UI
**Target Platform**: Linux server, browser (latest Chrome/Edge/Firefox)
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend + backend)
**Performance Goals**: 95% of users start puzzle <5s, API response <200ms
**Constraints**: All deliverables containerized, devcontainer support, F5 operable
**Scale/Scope**: Support 1000+ concurrent sessions, scalable API

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-11-01
- Q: Which UI framework should be used for the web-based Sudoku UI? → A: Blazor
- Q: Which storage solution should be used? → A: PostgreSQL
- Q: Which UI testing tool should be used? → A: Playwright

## Constitution Check


*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- All features must be implemented as standalone, testable libraries (Library-First): ✅
- CLI interface required for libraries: N/A (API focus)
- Test-First: All code must be covered by tests before implementation: ✅
- Integration Testing: Required for API endpoints and session management: ✅
- Observability & Versioning: Structured logging, versioning, and simplicity enforced: ✅
- Technology stack must be open source and use latest stable tools: ✅
- Prefer dotnet solutions/projects: ✅
- All deliverables containerized, devcontainer, F5 operable: ✅
- API required for stateful logic, UI must be dumb, no direct DB access from UI: ✅
- Security/performance compliance, deployment policies documented: ✅

No gate violations detected. Proceed to Phase 0.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
