# Feature Specification: Sudoku UI & API

**Feature Branch**: `001-sudoku-ui-api`  
**Created**: 2025-10-31  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create a UI and API to play Sudoku"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Play Sudoku Puzzle (Priority: P1)

A user wants to play a Sudoku puzzle through a web-based UI, interacting with the board and submitting moves.

**Why this priority**: Core user valueâ€”enables the main purpose of the product: playing Sudoku.

**Independent Test**: Open the UI, start a new puzzle, make moves, and complete the puzzle.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user on the UI, **When** they start a new puzzle, **Then** a valid Sudoku board is displayed.
2. **Given** a user is playing, **When** they enter a number, **Then** the move is validated and the board updates.
3. **Given** a user completes the puzzle, **When** the board is validated, **Then** a completion message is shown.

### User Story 2 - API Puzzle Management (Priority: P2)

A client (UI or external) wants to request, save, and validate Sudoku puzzles via the API.

**Why this priority**: Enables integration, persistence, and validation for puzzles.

**Independent Test**: Use the API to request a puzzle, submit moves, and validate completion.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an API client, **When** a new puzzle is requested, **Then** a valid puzzle is returned.
2. **Given** a puzzle in progress, **When** moves are submitted, **Then** the API validates and persists the state.
3. **Given** a completed puzzle, **When** the solution is submitted, **Then** the API validates and marks it as complete.

### User Story 3 - Error Handling & Feedback (Priority: P3)

A user or client encounters an error (invalid move, server issue) and receives clear feedback.

**Why this priority**: Ensures usability and reliability.

**Independent Test**: Attempt an invalid move or trigger an error, and verify feedback is clear and actionable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user submits an invalid move, **When** the system detects it, **Then** an error message is shown.
2. **Given** a server/API error, **When** the client receives a response, **Then** the error is clear and actionable.

### Edge Cases

- What happens if a puzzle cannot be generated? Show an error and allow retry.
- How does the system handle concurrent moves or sessions? Last valid move wins; conflicts resolved by API.
- What if the UI loses connection to the API? Show offline message and retry options.
- How are invalid inputs handled? UI restricts input; API validates and rejects invalid data.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a web-based UI for playing Sudoku puzzles.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST expose an API for puzzle generation, move validation, and state persistence.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to start, play, and complete Sudoku puzzles via the UI.
- **FR-004**: The API MUST validate moves and puzzle completion.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST provide clear error messages for invalid moves and system errors.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST persist puzzle state for ongoing games.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST support multiple concurrent sessions.

### Key Entities

- **User**: Represents a player; attributes: user id, display name, session history.
- **SudokuPuzzle**: Represents a puzzle; attributes: puzzle id, initial board, solution, difficulty.
- **GameSession**: Represents a play session; attributes: session id, user id, puzzle id, current state, status.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 95% of users can start a new puzzle in under 5 seconds.
- **SC-002**: 90% of API requests for new puzzles return valid boards.
- **SC-003**: 90% of users complete a puzzle without encountering system errors.
- **SC-004**: 100% of invalid moves are detected and result in clear feedback.
- **SC-005**: 95% of sessions persist state correctly across reconnects.

## Assumptions

- UI is web-based and interacts only with the API.
- API is stateless except for session persistence.
- No authentication required for MVP.
- Puzzle generation uses standard algorithms.
- Error handling prioritizes user clarity.
